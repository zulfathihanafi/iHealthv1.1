# iHealthv1.1
This is a project for my group assignment in university

We need to create a system for patient to make appointment to the clinic.
With this application, the staff of the clininc can also monitor the time for appointment and edit 
the time for opening/closing of the clinic

For the GUI, I created it using SceneBuilder, which use the FXML file, which is very easy to be controlled
Have fun!!!!
